# Archestyle() {

**Archestyle** is general namespace in @araclx, which stands for coding standards along all products on which we're
working. Our motivation for building this project was maintaining products in same codestyle along all product/services
teams. In this repository we're holding our linters, styleguides and guidelines for programming in @araclx.

> In case you would like to try, early configuration of linters used in our company - you can clone
> [repository that we've created to bootstrap linters in new projects](https://github.com/araclx/noddy).
